                    Code till dead - A journey of self-development
                </h1>
                <p class="body-paragraph">
                    Hello there! My name is Fabio, otherwise known as the
                    aeolicdino. I'm starting on a journey of learning and
                    advancement of my skills mostly because it scares me how
                    fast I am aging and I fear not being able to accomplish my
                    dreams.
                </p>
                <p class="body-paragraph">
                    Code till dead is a challenge in discipline and focus.
                    Recently I have been thinking deeply about how despite me
                    spending considerable time studying computer science and
                    coding, I still remain way behind my peers in terms of
                    programming skill. Part of the blame lies in the rocky
                    teenage and early adult years that I lived. But more so, I
                    believe that not being able to focus deeply on a single
                    activity has negatively impacted my ability to adquire any
                    long-lasting knowledge. I have come to the conclusion that
                    spreading yourself too thin is not an effective strategy
                    when it comes to becoming good at something -- A
                    conversation for another time perhaps.

                    Today is my first day writing this journal. I expect not
                    many people will arrive here, but I feel the need to explain
                    the motivations for the project nonetheless. This blog will
                    serve indirectly as a record of my progress as I develop my
                    skills. Hopefully, as I become a better developer and
                    writer, the quality of my blog will improve as well. From
                    the quality and content of my writing, to the projects
                    featured in my blogs, I suppose everything will become
                    better in time.

                    To those who read, you do not have to agree with anything I
                    write about. In fact, I presume many of my own personal
                    convictions fall outside what is considred "acceptable" in
                    modern social norm. Remember that as much as I am grateful
                    for it, you were the one who ultimately chose to read on. At
                    any time if you find yourself overly emotional over a topic
                    written in here, take a chill pill and spend some time
                    somewhere else.

                    That being said, I welcome criticism! We shall abide from
                    now on by a single principle when offering our opinions -
                    prejudice egalitarianism. You are free to share your raw
                    unfiltered opinions even if offensive. I just ask that you
                    remain consistent in your arguments and try whenever
                    possible to remember that no one is perfect. Having agreed
                    on the premise that no one is perfect, let us try to
                    criticize everything in a similar manner. If you think Java
                    is shit, remember that JavaScript is worse.

                    That would be all for today! Good luck to me, and see you
                    next time!
